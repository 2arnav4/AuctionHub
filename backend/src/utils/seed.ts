/**
 * Creates a demo room with a prepared catalog so a walkthrough does not begin
 * with several minutes of typing item names.
 *
 * Writes straight to MongoDB rather than going through the API, because the
 * host's room session token is issued at creation and is the one thing the
 * script needs to hand back — the REST client would keep it in a cookie jar
 * that the browser cannot read.
 *
 * Run with: npm run seed
